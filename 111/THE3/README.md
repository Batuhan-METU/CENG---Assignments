This folder contains a student-written tester for the THE3 assignment.
The actual grading will not be based on these test cases.
It is possible to score 100 on this tester but get 80 on the assignment, and vice versa.
However, scoring 100 on this tester provides a strong indication that your code is likely correct.

Since the tester was prepared by a student, encountering some potential errors is normal. Please feel free to report any issues.
The tester includes approximately 30,000 test cases, so running all of them may take a considerable amount of time.

To use the tester, simply replace the the3.py file in the folder with your own assignment file.
Then, run the corresponding Python file for the type of test case you want to try.
Do not worry too much if your code runs slowly on large and huge test cases; these are included for those who wish to challenge themselves.
If you can score full points on the small and medium test cases, it is HIGHLY LIKELY that this will be sufficient.

When you run the tester, you can view which cases fail directly in the terminal.
If you open a test case file, its format is as follows:
- The first line contains two integers: the length of the string list in the case and the number of characters in each string.
- The next n lines contain the string list.
- Following that, the correct output for the case is provided as an integer.
- Finally, a list of the rectangles to be counted is included in the format specified in the assignment document.

Remember, you are only required to write a single function and return a single integer.
